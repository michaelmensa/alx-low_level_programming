What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
What are the differences between static and shared libraries
Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig

What is a Stack Data Structure?
You can refer to Stack as a linear form of data structure. In this, a user can delete and insert elements from only one side of a list. It is known as the top. The stack data structure implements and follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It implies that the element that is inserted last comes out first.

The process of inserting an element in the stack is known as the push operation. Here, the deletion of elements is known as the pop operation. A user can feasibly keep track of the last function/element of the list in a stack using a pointer (top).

What Is a Queue Data Structure?
You can also refer to Queue as a linear form of data structure. In this, a user can insert elements from only one side of the list. It is known as the rear. Also, one can delete these elements from another side- known as the front. This type of data structure implements and follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It implies that the first element that inserts into a list will come out first.

The process of inserting an element into a queue is known as the enqueue operation. Here, the process of deleting an element is known as the dequeue operation. A user can always hold two pointers in a queue. The front pointer points to the first inserted element that is still in the list. The second pointer is the rear one that points to the last inserted element in the list.
